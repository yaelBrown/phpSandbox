PHP - https://www.php.net/manual/en/langref.php

php -S localhost:4000 - starts php
  Have to be in the directory with your files

<? [php code] ?> - php tag

; - Need semi-colons after every php command (not codeblock)

Very tightly coupled with html

Php datatypes -
  String
  Integer
  Float (floating point numbers - also called double)
  Boolean
  Array
  Object
  NULL
  Resource

Math operations - similar python without having to call the Math library.

Associative Array
  $arr = array("one" => 1, "two" => 2, "three" => 3)
  echo $arr["two"]

  Key/Value array. 
  Keys need to be unique

Very similar to javascript

Including html - used for creating header and footer
